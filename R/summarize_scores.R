#' Summarize a default set of assessments into a single risk score
#'
#' This function serves as an example for how a risk score might be derived.
#' Assuming all assessments provided by \code{riskmetric} are available in a
#' dataset, this function can be used to calculate a vector of risks.
#'
#' @param data a \code{\link[tibble]{tibble}} of scored assessments whose column
#'   names match those provided by riskmetric's \code{\link{pkg_assess}} function.
#' @param weights an optional vector of non-negative weights to be assigned to
#'   each assessment.
#'
#' @return a numeric vector of risk scores
