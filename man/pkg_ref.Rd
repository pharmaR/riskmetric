\title{Create a package reference}
\usage{
pkg_ref(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A singular \code{character} value, \code{character vector} or
\code{list} of \code{character} values of package names or source code
directory paths.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods.}
}
\value{
When a single value is provided, a single \code{pkg_ref} object is
  returned, possibly with a subclass based on where the package was found. If
  a \code{vector} or \code{list} is provided, a \code{list_of_pkg_ref} object
  constructed with \code{\link[vctrs]{list_of}} is returned, which can be
  considered analogous to a \code{list}. See 'Details' for further
  information about \code{pkg_ref} subclasses.
}
\description{
Create a package reference from package name or filepath, producing an object
in which package metadata will be collected as risk assessments are
performed. Depending on where the package was found - whether it is found as
source code, in a local library or from a remote host - an S3 subclass is
given to allow for source-specific collection of metadata. See 'Details' for
a breakdown of subclasses.
}
\details{
Package reference objects are used to collect metadata pertaining to a given
package. As data is needed for assessing a package's risk, this metadata
populates fields within the package reference object.

The \code{pkg_ref} S3 subclasses are used extensively for divergent metdata
collection behaviors dependent on where the package was discovered. Because
of this, there is a rich hierarchy of subclasses to articulate the different
ways package information can be found.
