\title{Flatten scored metrics to DCF-style key-value pairs}
\usage{
pkg_metric_export(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A `tbl_df` or `list` returned by `pkg_score()`, containing scored
`pkg_metric` values. The input may come from `pkg_score.tbl_df()` (for
many packages) or `pkg_score.list_of_pkg_metric()` (for a single package).}

\item{...}{additional arguments unused}
}
\value{
A character vector, where each element is a DCF-style line
  representing one scored metric (e.g., `"MetricHasNews: 1"`).
}
\description{
`pkg_metric_export()` converts scored package metrics into a flat list of
character strings in DCF (Debian Control File) style. Each metric is
written as a line in the form `Metric<Name>: <value>`, where `<Name>` is the
PascalCase transformation of the metric name.
}
\details{
This is useful for exporting results from `pkg_score()` into formats that
require simple key-value structures.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# For a single package
metrics <- pkg_score(pkg_assess(pkg_ref("riskmetric")))[[1]]
pkg_metric_export(metrics)

# For a data frame of packages
library(dplyr)
scores <- pkg_score(pkg_assess(as_tibble(pkg_ref("riskmetric"))))
pkg_metric_export(scores[1, ])  # flatten first package's results
}

}
